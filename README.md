SmartSignal AI
==============

SmartSignal AI is a fast, modern stock signal system powered by machine learning. 
It uses a Random Forest model trained on 10+ technical indicators to generate 
daily buy/sell signals for any stock ticker. The workflow is fully automated, 
backtested, and visualized in a beautiful Streamlit dashboard.
